# My_Learning_Port_II

Hello, and welcome back! This is a continuation of my learning development repository, carrying on from **[My_Learning_Port](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port)** GitHub repository. This will show my step-by-step development through various coding languages and techniques which will be necessary for me to retain my knowledge of web development skills.

## About Me

As stated previously, I have achieved a Certificate of Completion from the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp. In the UofO Bootcamp, we studied all of the necessary coding languages and techniques needed to become a Full-Stack Web Developer, which are the following:

* Git
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* React.js

Some skills and technologies I have achieved from my previous **[My_Learning_Port](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port)** repository (some briefly, and some more in-depth) are as follows:

* Ember.js
* Vue.js
* Svelte.js
* Angular.js
* Django
* Python
* Heroku
* Postgres

## The Purpose of This Repository

Although I did complete and graduate from the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp, I must confess it was a bit difficult to retain all of the knowledge which was afforded to me through the UofO program. But studying through [Mozilla's Development Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (as represented in **[My_Learning_Port](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port)** respository), I truly feel as though I have gained a much deeper knowledge of the previous languages and technologies I have listed above.

I have created this **My_Learning_Port_II** repository -- well, mainly because I was running out of room in my previous **My_Learning_Port** repository :smile: -- but also to further my knowledge of languages and technologies beyond the scope of *Mozilla's Developer Network*, starting with a continuation of the Django web framework technology (mainly because I had so much fun working with Django in the previous repository!)

So, follow along with me as I take a deeper dive into [Django]()! Thanks for coming along!
