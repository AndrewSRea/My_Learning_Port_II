# Quick install guide

Before you can use Django, you'll need to get it installed. We have a [complete installation guide]() <!-- link to internal folder? Or to DjangoProject? (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/install/) --> that covers all the possibilities; this guide will guide you to a minimal installation that'll work while you walk through the introduction.
