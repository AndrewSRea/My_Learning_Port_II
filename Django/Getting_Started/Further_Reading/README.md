# What to read next

So you've read all the [introductory material]() <!-- link to Table of Contents on the Django opening README? --> and have decided you'd like to keep using Django. We've only scratched the surface with this intro. (In fact, if you've read every single word, you've read about 5% of the overall documentation.)

So what's next?

Well, we've always been big fans of learning by doing. At this point, you should know enough to start a project of your own and start fooling around. As you need to learn new tricks, come back to the documentation.

We've put a lot of effort into making Django's documentation useful, clear, and as complete as possible. The rest of this document explains more about how the documentation works so that you can get the most out of it.

(Yes, this is documentation about documentation. Rest assured we have no plans to write a document about how to read the document about documentation.)
