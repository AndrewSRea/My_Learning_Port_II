# What to read next

So you've read all the [introductory material]() <!-- link to Table of Contents on the Django opening README? --> and have decided you'd like to keep using Django. We've only scratched the surface with this intro. (In fact, if you've read every single word, you've read about 5% of the overall documentation.)

So what's next?

Well, we've always been big fans of learning by doing. At this point, you should know enough to start a project of your own and start fooling around. As you need to learn new tricks, come back to the documentation.

We've put a lot of effort into making Django's documentation useful, clear, and as complete as possible. The rest of this document explains more about how the documentation works so that you can get the most out of it.

(Yes, this is documentation about documentation. Rest assured we have no plans to write a document about how to read the document about documentation.)

## Finding documentation

Django's got a *lot* of documentation -- almost 450,000 words and counting -- so finding what you need can sometimes be tricky. A good place to start is the [Index](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/genindex/). We also recommend using the built-in search feature.

Or you can just browse around!

## How the documentation is organized

Django's main documentation is broken up into "chunks" designed to fill different needs:

* The [introductory material]() <!-- link to Table of Contents on the Django opening README? --> is designed for people new to Django -- or to web development in general. It doesn't cover anything in depth, but instead gives a high-level overview to how developing in Django "feels".
* The [topic guides](), on the other hand, dive deep into individual parts of Django. There are complete guides to Django's [model system](), [template engine](), [forms framework](), and much more. This is probably where you'll want to spend most of your time; if you work your way through these guides, you should come out knowing pretty much everything there is to know about Django. <!-- "topic guides", a link to the "Django Docs" opening page Table of Contents? Other subarticles, "model system", etc., with their own links. -->
* Web development is often broad, not deep -- problems span many domains. We've written a set of [how-to guides](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/) that answer common "How do I...?" questions. Here you'll find information about [generating PDFs with Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/outputting-pdf/), [writing custom template tags](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/custom-template-tags/), and more. Answers to really common questions can also be found in the [FAQ](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/faq/).
* The guides and how-to's don't cover every single class, function, and method available in Django -- that would be overwhelming when you're trying to learn. Instead, details about individual classes, functions, methods, and modules are kept in the [reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/). This is where you'll turn to find the details of a particular function or whatever you need.
* If you are interested in deploying a project for public use, our docs have [several guides](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/) for various deployment setups as well as a [deployment checklist](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/checklist/) for some things you'll need to think about. <!-- These two links might be in my further documentation. -->
* Finally, there's some "specialized" documentation not usually relevant to most developers. This includes the [release notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/releases/) and [internals documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/internals/) for those who want to add code to Django itself, and a [few other things that don't fit elsewhere](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/misc/).
