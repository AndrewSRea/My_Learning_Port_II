# Making queries

Once you've created your [data models](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port_II/tree/main/Django/Django_Docs/Models_and_Databases/Models#models), Django automatically gives you a database-abstraction API that lets you create, retrieve, update, and delete objects. This document explains how to use this API. Refer to the [data model reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/) for full details of all the various model lookup options.
