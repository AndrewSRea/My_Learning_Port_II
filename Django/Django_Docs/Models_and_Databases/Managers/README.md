# Managers

#### *`class`* `Manager`

A `Manager` is the interface through which database query operations are provided to Django models. At least one `Manager` exists for every model in a Django application.

The way `Manager` classes work is documented in [Making queries](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port_II/tree/main/Django/Django_Docs/Models_and_Databases/Making_Queries#making-queries); this document specifically touches on model options that customize `Manager` behavior.
