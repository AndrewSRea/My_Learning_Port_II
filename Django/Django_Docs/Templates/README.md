# Templates

Being a web framework, Django needs a convenient way to generate HTML dynamically. The most common approach relies on templates. A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted. For a hands-on example of creating HTML pages with templates, see [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port_II/tree/main/Django/Getting_Started/Tutorial_3#writing-your-first-django-app---part-3).
