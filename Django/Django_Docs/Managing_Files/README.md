# Managing files

This document describes Django's file access APIs for files such as those uploaded by a user. The lower level APIs are general enough that you could use them for other purposes. If you want to handle "static files" (JS, CSS, etc.), see [How to manage static files (e.g. images, JavaScript, CSS)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/).
