# Creating forms from models

## `ModelForm`

##### `class ModelForm`

If you're building a database-driven app, chances are you'll have forms that map closely to Django models. For instance, you might have a `BlogComment` model, and you want to create a form that lets people submit comments. In this case, it would be redundant to define the field types in your form, because you've already defined the fields in your model.
